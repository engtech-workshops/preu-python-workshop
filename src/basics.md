        ## What do you think is programming?

        ### Actually....

        Programming is like "talking" to a computer - you want the computer to understand your words or instructions.

        * Think and plan what you want to achieve with the code
        * Break it down to smaller steps
        * Tackle the steps one at a time (write snippets of code and test!)
